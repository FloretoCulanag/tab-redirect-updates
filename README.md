Protect your download page from being bookmarked and accessed directly.
The Tab Redirect plugin is a WordPress plugin designed to enhance the user experience on your website. It redirects users to the homepage after a specified amount of time has passed or when they switch tabs on download pages. This plugin is particularly useful for websites that offer downloads and want to ensure that users stay engaged with the site.

Features

- Tab Inactivity Redirect: If a user switches tabs while on a download page, they will be redirected to the homepage.
- Time-Based Redirect: Users will be redirected to the homepage after a specified amount of time has passed, regardless of whether the tab is active or not.
- Customizable Settings: You can customize the download path, homepage URL, and expiration time through the plugin's settings page.
- Homepage Access Restriction: The plugin checks if the user came from the homepage before allowing access to download pages. If a user tries to access a download page directly, they will be redirected to the homepage.
